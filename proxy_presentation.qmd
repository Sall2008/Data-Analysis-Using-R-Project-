## Distance to Schools and House Prices: Hypotheses & Regression Strategy {.smaller}

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
### H1: House prices are higher related to schools

*(Expected: Negative coefficients on distance variables)*
:::

**Empirical Framework:**

-   **Outcome:** **Log house price**
-   **Key variables:** Distance to nearest **primary** school, Distance to nearest **secondary** school
-   **Modeling Strategy:** Models use **continuous, quadratic, and binned** specs for flexible gradients.

::: {.column width="48%"}
### Baseline OLS Controls

*Standardizing housing attributes*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Living area
-   Plot area
-   Number of rooms
-   House age

::: {.column width="48%"}
### Two Distance Designs

*Alternative specifications*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1. Continuous**

-   quadratic ($km^2$)

**2. Binned**

-   0–3 km, 3–6 km, 6–9 km, \>9 km

## Regression Specifications: Continuous Distance

::::::::: columns
::::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
### 1. Naive Specification (Unconditional)

*Raw price gradient without controls* $$\ln(P) = \alpha + \beta_1 D^{prim} + \beta_2 D^{sec} + \varepsilon$$

-   **Goal:** Establish raw spatial correlation.

-   **Risk:** High Omitted Variable Bias (OVB).
:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default"}
### 2. Baseline Model (Preferred)

*Conditional on attributes (*$\mathbf{X}$) $$\ln(P) = \alpha + \mathbf{\beta D} + \mathbf{\gamma X} + \varepsilon$$

-   $\mathbf{X}$: Area, Plot size, Rooms, Age.

-   **Assumption:** $E[\varepsilon|\mathbf{D}, \mathbf{X}] = 0$.

-   **Hypothesis:** $\beta < 0$ (Negative semi-elasticity).
:::
:::::

::::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
### 3. Polynomial (Non-Linearity)

*Testing for convex/concave decay* $$\ln(P) = \text{Baseline} \dots + \delta_1 (D^{prim})^2 + \dots$$

-   **Test:** $\delta \neq 0$ implies marginal willingness to pay varies with distance.
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
### 4 & 5. Single-Type Robustness

*Addressing multicollinearity* $$\ln(P) = \alpha + \beta_{k} D^{k} + \mathbf{\gamma X} + \varepsilon$$

-   **Method:** Estimate $D^{prim}$ and $D^{sec}$ separately.

-   **Check:** Ensure $\hat{\beta}$ signs remain stable when isolated.

### 📉 Negative Slope (H1)

Clear decay in prices as distance increases across both specifications.

### 📐 Non-Linearity

Steeper drop in the first 3-6 km, flattening afterwards.

### 🏫 School Heterogeneity

Primary schools (Blue) show a visibly steeper gradient than Secondary schools.

## Interpreting the Results: Economic Mechanisms

::: panel-tabset

### 1. Capitalization
**Why are houses closer to schools more expensive?**

* **Commuting Costs & Convenience**
    * Time saved on daily school runs is directly capitalized into housing values.
    * Particularly critical for dual-income households with tight schedules.

* **Residential Sorting**
    * Families with children self-select into these areas.
    * This clustering increases local demand and price pressure compared to non-school areas.

### 2. Primary vs Secondary
**Why is the effect stronger for primary schools?**

* **Age-Related Mobility Constraints**
    * Young children cannot commute independently; parents *must* escort them.
    * This makes proximity a "non-negotiable" constraint for primary school parents.

* **Neighborhood Definition**
    * Primary schools act as the center of the local "micro-neighborhood."
    * Secondary schools serve larger regions, and older students use public transport, reducing the premium on immediate proximity.

### 3. Non-Linearity
**Why does the price gradient flatten out?**

* **Diminishing Returns (Threshold Effects)**
    * The "Walkability Premium" exists only within the first few kilometers.
    * Once driving is required, the marginal difference between 5km and 8km is negligible.

* **Substitution Effects**
    * At larger distances, alternative transport modes (school buses, public transit) replace parental driving, flattening the cost curve.

### 4. Limitation
**What is missing from a distance-only perspective?**

* **Distance $\neq$ Desirability**
    * Proximity captures *accessibility*, but not *quality*.
    * Living next to a poorly-performing school may actually be a disamenity (noise, traffic) without the educational benefit.

* **The "Social" Omitted Variable**
    * We need to control for **Social Index/Composition** to distinguish between "access to any school" and "access to a *good* school."
