## Research question

How does the social index of schools influence housing prices, and does the proximity to schools modulate this effect in urban areas?

## Findings from literature

Many papers suggest that there is a connection between school performance or school quality and housing prices as parents value the education of their children [see @Machin_2011].

## Usage of available data

## Proposed empirical model

## Shortcomings of our empirical strategy
- A regression-based hedonic model in the housing context might be prone to
certain endogeneity problems due to omitted variables.
- A reason for that is the extensive scope of relevant housing characteristics and demographic features
