# Motivation, Existing Literature & Research Question

## Motivation

-   **Personal Interest**: Analyzing the real estate market's reaction
    to various factors is particularly interesting from an economic
    standpoint, as it offers insights into market dynamics.
    Additionally, the topic is personally intriguing, adding an extra
    layer of motivation to explore it further.

-   **Academic and Practical Relevance**: Housing markets are influenced
    by various social and economic factors, and school quality is also
    cited as a underestimated determinant of property values, especially
    in research [@Seo_Simons_2009].

## Motivation

Understanding the relationship between school distance, school quality
and property prices can provide valuable insights for researchers and
individuals interested in the real estate market.

## Related Literature Background

Several papers have examined the effect of proximity to schools on
housing prices:

-   **Empirical Strategies**: While hedonic models are the dominant
    approach to estimating housing price effects, alternative empirical
    strategies have also been proposed [see @Black_Machin_2011]

-   **Findings**: Empirical evidence suggests that proximity to schools
    positively affects housing prices [@Rosiers_Lagana_Theriault_2001;
    @Huang_Hess_2018]

## Related Literature Background

-   **Other Factors**: Related work also documents capitalization
    effects of school reputation [@Chin_Foong_2006], differences between
    public and private schools [@Sah_Conroy_Narwold_2016] and school
    quality [@Edusei_Espey_Lin_2007; @Metz_2015]

-   **Environment of studies**: Much of the literature focuses on
    settings with binding school catchment areas and measures school
    quality primarily through test scores rather than demographic
    composition.

## Research Question

We study a setting *without binding school catchment areas* (NRW,
Germany) and assess whether both *school proximity* and a
*demographically based school* *social index* are capitalized into
housing prices.

## Research Question

**Research Question:** How do school proximity and school social indices
affect the prices of detached houses, and do these effects differ
between primary and secondary schools in North Rhine–Westphalia?

# Data & Methodology

## Data

-   **Housing Data**: Cross-section dataset for houses for sale
    published by the Research Data Center Ruhr (FDZ Ruhr)
    [@RWI_ImmobilienScout24_2023].
-   **School Data**: School social index dataset from North
    Rhine-Westphalias Ministry of Schools and Education
    [@MSB_NRW_Schulsozialindex].

\footnotetext{Data used from both datasets refer to the year 2022.}

## Empirical Framework

We estimate regression-based hedonic models to

-   examine how school proximity and school characteristics are
    capitalized into housing prices and
-   whether the impact of school proximity on housing prices differs by
    the school’s social index

## Empirical Framework: Hedonic Price Model

\begin{center}
\colorbox{blue!10}{
$\displaystyle
\log(P_i) = 
\beta_0 + 
\beta_1 \text{Dist}_i + 
X_i' \gamma + 
\varepsilon_i
$
}
\end{center}

\vspace{1.5em}

-   $P_i$ denotes the listing price of house $i$ \vspace{0.1em}
-   $\text{Dist}_i$ measures distance to the nearest school
    \vspace{0.1em}
-   $X_i$ is a vector of housing characteristics \vspace{0.1em}
-   $\gamma$ is a vector of coefficients corresponding to $X_i$
    \vspace{0.1em}
-   $\varepsilon_i$ captures unobserved factors

## Empirical Framework: Hedonic Price Model + Interaction

\begin{center}
\colorbox{blue!10}{
$\displaystyle
\log(P_i) = 
\beta_0 + 
\beta_1 ( \text{Index}_i \times \text{Dist}_i ) + 
X_i' \gamma
+ \varepsilon_i
$
}
\end{center}

\vspace{1.5em}

-   $P_i$ denotes the listing price of house $i$ \vspace{0.1em}
-   $\text{Index}_i$ is the school social index \vspace{0.1em}
-   $\text{Dist}_i$ measures distance to the nearest school
    \vspace{0.1em}
-   $X_i$ is a vector of housing characteristics \vspace{0.1em}
-   $\varepsilon_i$ captures unobserved factors

## Empirical Framework: Final Model

\begin{center}
\colorbox{blue!10}{
$\displaystyle
\begin{aligned}
\log(P_i)
&=
\beta_0
+ \beta_1 \text{Dist}_i
+ \beta_2 \text{Index}_i \\
&\quad
+ \beta_3 \left( \text{Dist}_i \times \text{Index}_i \right)
+ X_i' \gamma
+ \mu_{\ell(i)}
+ \varepsilon_i
\end{aligned}
$
}
\end{center}

-   $P_i$ denotes the listing price of house $i$ \vspace{0.1em}
-   $\text{Dist}_i$ measures distance to the nearest school
    \vspace{0.1em}
-   $X_i$ is a vector of housing characteristics \vspace{0.1em}

## Exploring the Social Index Impact on House Prices

\medskip
\fcolorbox{blue!60}{white}{
\parbox{\linewidth}{
\textbf{H2: Social index moderates the effect of school proximity on house prices}\\[-2pt]
\emph{Expected: Better schools leading to stronger price premiums}
}}
\medskip

-   **Key Finding from Distance Analysis:** We’ve already established that *households are willing to pay a premium* for proximity to schools
-   **Next Question:** Now, we investigate *whether this price premium is driven by school quality*, measured through the *Social Index*


## What is the Social Index?

**Definition**: The Social Index is a measure that shows the socio-economic and demographic background of a schools students.
  
**Components of the social index are**:

-   Parental Education 
-   Socio-economic Status of the Family 
-   Migration Background
-   Single-Parent Household
-   Unemployment in the Family 
-   Housing Situation 
  
--> It provides insights into the **social environment** that might influence housing prices in that area.


## Categorization of the Social Index

**Social Index Classification:**

-   **Good Schools**: Social Index 1-2
-   **Average Schools**: Social Index 3-4
-   **Bad Schools**: Social Index 5-8


-    **Skewed Distribution**: The Social Index classes are heavily skewed, with many schools falling into classes 1, 2 & 3. We excluded class 9 for our analysis because of too less observations

## Social Index: Interpretaition of the Results
### Primary School Proximity

-   *Distance to primary school* is still *significant* and negatively affects house prices.
-   Interaction Effect: The effect is *stronger for average schools* (Estimate = -0.041, p = 0.009), suggesting that the price drop is greater when the school quality is average.
-   *No significant effect* for bad schools (p = 0.2996).
  
## Social Index: Interpretaition of the Results
### Secondary School Proximity

-   *Distance to secondary school* is also still *significant* and negatively impacts house prices.
-   The effect is *stronger for average schools* (Estimate = 0.0307, p = 0.0096), meaning proximity to secondary schools is more impactful in areas with average school quality.
-   *No significant effect* for bad schools (p = 0.7414).

```{r}
#| include: true 
```

## Limitations

-   **Direct Distance**: The distance is not measured from the houses to
    the nearest school directly but from the school to the center of the
    raster cell.
-   **Fragmented Grid**: We do not have data for every grid cell of NRW
    but only a fragmented set of grids containing houses from the
    available datasets.
-   **Listing prices**: The prices we have are not transaction but
    listing prices.
