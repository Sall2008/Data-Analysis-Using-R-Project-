# Motivation, Existing Literature \& Research Question

## Motivation

- **Personal Interest**: Analyzing the real estate market's reaction to various 
factors is particularly interesting from an economic standpoint, as it offers 
insights into market dynamics. Additionally, the topic is personally intriguing, 
adding an extra layer of motivation to explore it further.

- **Academic and Practical Relevance**: Housing markets are influenced by 
various social and  economic factors, and school quality is also cited as a 
underestimated determinant of property values, especially in research 
[@Seo_Simons_2009].


## Motivation

Understanding the relationship between school distance, school quality and 
property prices can provide valuable insights for researchers and individuals 
interested in the real estate market.  


## Related Literature Background

Several papers have examined the effect of proximity to schools on housing 
prices:

- **Empirical Strategies**: While hedonic models are the dominant approach to 
estimating housing price effects, alternative empirical strategies have also 
been proposed [see @Black_Machin_2011]

- **Findings**: Empirical evidence suggests that proximity to schools positively 
affects housing prices [@Rosiers_Lagana_Theriault_2001; @Huang_Hess_2018]

## Related Literature Background

- **Other Factors**: Related work also documents capitalization effects of school 
reputation [@Chin_Foong_2006], differences between public and private schools 
[@Sah_Conroy_Narwold_2016] and school quality [@Edusei_Espey_Lin_2007; 
@Metz_2015]

- **Environment of studies**: Much of the literature focuses on settings with 
binding school catchment areas and measures school quality primarily through 
test scores rather than demographic composition.


## Research Question

We study a setting *without binding school catchment areas* (NRW, Germany)
and assess whether both *school proximity* and a *demographically based school* 
*social index* are capitalized into housing prices.

## Research Question

**Research Question:** How do school proximity and school social indices affect 
the prices of detached houses, and do these effects differ between primary and 
secondary schools in North Rhine–Westphalia?

# Data \& Methodology

## Data

- **Housing Data**: Cross-section dataset for  houses for sale published by the 
Research Data Center Ruhr (FDZ Ruhr) [@RWI_ImmobilienScout24_2023]. 
- **School Data**:
