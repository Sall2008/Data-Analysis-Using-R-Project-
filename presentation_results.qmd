# Motivation, Existing Literature \& Research Question

## Motivation

- **Personal Interest**: Analyzing the real estate market's reaction to various 
factors is particularly interesting from an economic standpoint, as it offers 
insights into market dynamics. Additionally, the topic is personally intriguing, 
adding an extra layer of motivation to explore it further.

- **Academic and Practical Relevance**: Housing markets are influenced by 
various social and  economic factors, and school quality is also cited as a 
underestimated determinant of property values, especially in research 
[@Seo_Simons_2009].


## Motivation

Understanding the relationship between school distance, school quality and 
property prices can provide valuable insights for researchers and individuals 
interested in the real estate market.  


## Related Literature Background



## Research Question

**Research Question:** How does the social index of schools influence housing 
prices, and does the proximity to schools modulate this effect?

# Data \& Methodology

## Data

- **Housing Data**: Cross-section dataset for  houses for sale published by the 
Research Data Center Ruhr (FDZ Ruhr) [@RWI_ImmobilienScout24_2023].
