While highly variable in terms of research quality, the literature consistently finds housing valuations to be significantly higher in places where measured school quality is higher. Thus parents are prepared to pay substantial amounts of money to get their children educated in better performing schools. This conclusion emerges from studies across many countries, using a variety of identification strategies, and at different levels of the education system.}, journal={Handbook of the Economics of Education}, author={Black, Sandra E. and Machin, Stephen}, year={2011}, pages={485–519}, language={en} }
